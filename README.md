# XPlate

XPlate is a general-purpose built template engine to receive any type of input
file as a variable set and output the templated files to any type of location.
Both the input and output are plugin-based and can be extended using any
programming language. Beside the extensibility of the input and output it is
also possible extend the engine with your custom go functions.

Accessing the given data in the template file is made possible by using
`JMESPath`, `JSONata`, `JSONPath`, or any kind of acces you would like to
implement yourself.
